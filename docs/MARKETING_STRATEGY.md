Hi {FirstName},

I noticed {Company} operates a {FacilityType} in {Location}.

Most facilities like yours waste 20-30% on peak demand charges and inefficient scheduling.

We've built an AI that automatically finds these savings opportunities - one client saved $47K in the first month just by shifting loads during TOU periods.

Would you be open to a 15-min demo to see if we can do the same for {Company}?
