## Method 1: LinkedIn (FREE - Best for Names)

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Go to LinkedIn** (linkedin.com - free account works)

2. **Use the search bar** at the top with this format:
   ```
   "Job Title" Company Name Location
   ```

3. **Example for Cologix:**
   ```
   "VP Operations" Cologix Toronto
   ```
   OR
   ```
   "Facilities Director" Cologix Toronto
   ```

4. **Filter results:**
   - Click "People" tab
   - Under "Location" → Select "Greater Toronto Area"
   - Under "Current company" → Type the company name

5. **Find the right person:**
   - Look for titles like:
     - VP Operations
     - Director of Facilities
     - Facilities Manager
     - Energy Manager (rare but perfect!)
     - Plant Manager (for manufacturing)

6. **What to do when you find them:**
   - **Option A:** Send LinkedIn message directly (free 50/day limit)
   - **Option B:** Note their full name and use Method 2 to find email

## Method 5: Cold Calling to Get Contact Info (FREE)

**This works surprisingly well:**

1. **Call the main switchboard** (numbers provided in CSV)

2. **Script:**
   ```
   "Hi, I'm looking to send some information about energy cost
   reduction to your facilities director. Could you tell me their
   name and email address?"
   ```

3. **Alternative script:**
   ```
   "Hi, I need to send a proposal to your VP of Operations. What's
   the best email address to reach them at?"
   ```

4. **If they ask why:**
   ```
   "We provide AI-powered energy management for data centers and
   wanted to share some case studies showing 25-30% cost reductions."
   ```

5. **What usually happens:**
   - Small companies: Receptionist gives you the info
   - Large companies: "Please send to info@company.com and we'll forward"
   - Medium companies: "Let me transfer you" → talk to facilities directly!

## Method 6: ZoomInfo (PAID - Best but Expensive)

**Cost:** $15,000-30,000/year (not recommended for early stage)

**What you get:**
- Direct dial phone numbers
